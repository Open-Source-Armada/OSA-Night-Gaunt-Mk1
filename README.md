//Tactics//


Starting as an attempt at a new armoured fighter, i changed the goal when plating was not providing the needed protection.

The frame was reworked into the largest amount of guns i could keep above 140 ms, without trails.

Most if not all miners, haulers and any other civilian ship are unarmoued, 6 guns will make quick work of them.

Most dont go max speed either, so you are not missing many targets of value.

Where i belive this ship will do best is hunting surface miners, as most are slow, and are practicaly stationary when mining.

Endos should be easy to kill with 6 guns, but remember that they can kill you too.

The unarmoued hull means you are relying on gank tactics, the element of surprise is your main advantage.

Dodfights should be avoided, even a tripod skiff can crit you.

There is no shame in running away from a fight in this ship, you have already left honour at the door when you pilot it.

I belive the hull of this ship is ripe for modification, different weapons, higher tier components, even armour and regular thrusters to convert over to the original goal.
